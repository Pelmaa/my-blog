                My journey into web development started in an unexpected way. I was one of 20 eager students 
                who had the incredible opportunity to learn from <strong>Trainee Pratap from Nepal</strong>, 
                who came all the way to Bhutan to teach us. This was at <strong>Athang Private Limited</strong>, 
                where my coding adventure would unfold over the next three months.

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    My first major project was building a calculator application. This project taught me the 
                    fundamentals of JavaScript logic, event handling, and user interface design. It was amazing 
                    to see numbers and operations come to life on the screen!

                    Working together as a class, we built a todo application that helped us understand state 
                    management, data persistence, and collaborative coding. This project showed me the power 
                    of working as a team and sharing knowledge.

                    Our capstone project was <strong>Watch Buddy</strong>, a group collaboration that brought 
                    together everything we had learned. This project challenged us to work with databases, 
                    create complex user interfaces, and deploy a real-world application. It was the perfect 
                    culmination of our learning journey.

                The final step in our journey was <strong>deployment</strong> - making our applications available 
                to the world. Learning how to deploy applications taught me that development is not just about 
                writing code, but also about sharing your creations with others. Seeing my projects live on the 
                internet for the first time was an incredible feeling!

                These three months at Athang Private Limited transformed me from a complete beginner to a 
                confident web developer. The guidance from Trainee Pratap, the support of my 19 fellow students, 
                and the hands-on learning approach made all the difference. This journey has opened up a world 
                of possibilities, and I'm excited to continue growing as a developer.
